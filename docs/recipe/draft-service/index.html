Eulogy (Mary Creswell)
Anyone who would like to take this opportunity to say a few words, please do so
Reading (Chris?)
Ecclesiastes 3 1:8
To everything there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:
a time to be born, and a time to die;
a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted;
a time to kill, and a time to heal;
a time to break down, and a time to build up;
a time to weep, and a time to laugh;
a time to mourn, and a time to dance;
a time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together;
a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;
a time to get, and a time to lose;
a time to keep, and a time to cast away;
a time to rend, and a time to sew;
a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;
a time to love, and a time to hate;
a time of war, and a time of peace.">

<h5 id="battle-hymn-of-the-republic">Battle Hymn of the Republic</h5>
<p><em>by J.W. Howe and W. Steffe</em></p>
<p>Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord:
He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored;
He hath loosed the fateful lightning of His terrible swift sword:
His truth is marching on.</p>
<p>(Chorus)
Glory, glory, hallelujah!
Glory, glory, hallelujah!
Glory, glory, hallelujah!
His truth is marching on.</p>
<p>I have seen Him in the watch-fires of a hundred circling camps,
They have builded Him an altar in the evening dews and damps;
I can read His righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps:
His day is marching on.
(Chorus)</p>
<p>He is coming like the glory of the morning on the wave,
He is Wisdom to the mighty, He is Succour to the brave,
So the world shall be His footstool, and the soul of Time His slave,
Our God is marching on.
(Chorus)</p>

<h5 id="i-am-standing-upon-the-seashore">I Am Standing Upon The Seashore</h5>
<p><em>by Henry Van Dyke</em></p>
<p>I am standing upon the seashore.
A ship at my side spreads her white
sails to the morning breeze and starts for the blue ocean.
She is an object of beauty and strength.</p>
<p>I stand and watch her until at length
she hangs like a speck of white cloud
just where the sea and sky come
to mingle with each other.</p>
<p>Then, someone at my side says;
&ldquo;There, she is gone!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Gone where?&rdquo;
Gone from my sight. That is all.
She is just as large in mast and hull
and spar as she was when she left my side
and she is just as able to bear her
load of living freight to her destined port.
Her diminished size is in me, not in her.</p>
<p>And just at the moment when someone
at my side says, &ldquo;There, she is gone!&rdquo;
There are other eyes watching her coming,
and other voices ready to take up the glad shout;
&ldquo;Here she comes!&rdquo;
And that is dying.</p>
<h3 id="reading-1">Reading</h3>
<h5 id="desiderata">Desiderata</h5>
<p><em>by Max Ehrmann</em></p>
<p>Go placidly amid the noise and the haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence. As far as possible, without surrender, be on good terms with all persons.</p>
<p>Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even to the dull and the ignorant; they too have their story.</p>
<p>Avoid loud and aggressive persons; they are vexatious to the spirit. If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain or bitter, for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.</p>
<p>Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. Keep interested in your own career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.</p>
<p>Exercise caution in your business affairs, for the world is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals, and everywhere life is full of heroism.</p>
<p>Be yourself. Especially do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment, it is as perennial as the grass.</p>
<p>Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth.</p>
<p>Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.</p>
<p>Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here.</p>
<p>And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be. And whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life, keep peace in your soul. With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be cheerful. Strive to be happy.</p>

<h5 id="immortality-read-by-hillary">Immortality (read by Hillary)</h5>
<p><em>by Clare Horner</em></p>
<p>Do not stand By my grave, and weep.
I am not there, I do not sleep—
I am the thousand winds that blow
I am the diamond glints in snow
I am the sunlight on ripened grain,
I am the gentle, autumn rain.
As you awake with morning&rsquo;s hush,
I am the swift, up-flinging rush
Of quiet birds in circling flight,
I am the day transcending night.
Do not stand
By my grave, and cry—
I am not there,
I did not die.</p>

<h5 id="tell-out-my-soul">Tell out my soul</h5>
<p><em>by Timothy Dudley-Smith</em></p>
<p>Tell out, my soul, the greatness of the Lord!
Unnumbered blessings give my spirit voice;
tender to me the promise of his word –
in God my Saviour shall my heart rejoice.</p>
<p>Tell out, my soul, the greatness of his name!
Make known his might, the deeds his arm has done;
his mercy sure, from age to age the same –
his holy name: the Lord, the Mighty One.</p>
<p>Tell out, my soul, the greatness of his might!
Powers and dominions lay their glory by;
proud hearts and stubborn wills are put to flight,
the hungry fed, the humble lifted high.</p>
<p>Tell out, my soul, the glories of his word!
Firm is his promise, and his mercy sure:
tell out, my soul, the greatness of the Lord
to children’s children and for evermore!</p>

<p>May the road rise to meet you,<br>
May the wind be always at your back.<br>
May the sun shine warm upon your face,<br>
The rains fall soft upon your fields.<br>
And until we meet again,<br>
May God hold you in the palm of his hand.</p>
