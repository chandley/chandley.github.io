Broadcast Notes 27th October 2014

I’m Chris Handley and I’ve just finished the first day of my twelve week coding course at Makers’ Academy, near London’s silicon roundabout. At the end I should have skills to work as a junior software developer, building web applications in Ruby on Rails, but learning about related technologies and ways of working. 

We’ll be spending most of our time writing code, rather than sitting in lectures, but there is also a strong emphasis on learning to teach yourself, help each other, and communicate clearly. A brilliant coder who cannot work as part of a team is not readily employable!

While preparing for the course, I’ve been very impressed by the software and learning materials available for free online. I’ve tried a few small projects, such as a text based adventure game. Each time I have written some ugly code, made lots of mistakes, and reached points where I have got stuck (often for several days). Experimentation and searching the internet have eventually got me there!

Introductions this morning showed that the class of 24 is a varied group - some fresh out of university, but many looking, like me, to pick up a new skill and change direction after a spell in the workplace.

After a short period setting up our computers we have got stuck into the mysteries of Test Driven Development. It seems strange to write a test before writing any code, but I can already see that it forces you to clearly define your problem before attempting the solution. We’ll be using this for almost everything going forwards.

I’ve had fun today learning to think in new ways, but the weeks ahead are definitely going to keep me busy! The teaching team here are very enthusiastic, which is important given the size of challenge ahead!
